### Sample Database for Sales Orders (saledb)
This project provides a sample database schema for a sales order system, named saledb. It includes tables representing:

- Customers: Information about customers placing orders.
- Products: Details about the products offered for sale.
- Product Lines: Categories that group related products (optional, depending on your data).
- Offices: Locations of company offices.
- Employees: Sales representatives and other staff (linked to specific offices).
- Orders: Details about customer orders.
- OrderDetails: Line items for each order, specifying products and quantities.
- Payments: Customer payments towards their orders (optional, depending on your data).
- Tables and Columns:

A detailed description of each table's columns and their data types can be found within the SQL code files.
Data Samples:

The project includes sample data inserted into most tables to demonstrate usage.
### How to Use This Project:

Import the SQL code files into your preferred SQL database management system.
The order of importing the files is important due to foreign key relationships. Here's a suggested order:
#### Create tables:
offices.sql
productlines.sql (if applicable)
products.sql
customers.sql
employees.sql
orders.sql
orderdetails.sql
payments.sql (if applicable)
- Insert sample data using the provided SQL statements or populate the tables with your own data.
- Use SQL queries to interact with the database and retrieve or manipulate data as needed.
